# Active-Directory-Homelab

## Summary
I create a homelab to simulate the use of Active Directory in the real world for learning purposes. The setup included creating a domain controller (DC) running Window servers which allows for the management of authentication, users, groups, and policies across a network.

## Creating Organizational Units (OU)
- A container which contains different kind of objects like users, computers, groups, domain, etc.
